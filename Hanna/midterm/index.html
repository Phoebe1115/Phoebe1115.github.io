                <h3>The Sagingan Festival</h3>
                <p>Bananas stand as the heart and soul of this town's culture, boasting 30 varieties. Tubod's progress and heritage are intricately woven together with this beloved fruit. The profound connection to bananas is the driving force behind the town's annual Sagingan (banana farm) Festival, a lively celebration that not only highlights bananas but also honors the unwavering dedication of its residents during the harvest season. The Sagingan Festival presents captivating performances during the street dancing and dance showdown competition that narrates a Tubod folktale. This story revolves around a Sultan (Muslim ruler or leader) who possesses the giant "puso sa saging" (banana bud) and rules over a town blessed with abundant banana harvests until an evil engkanto threatens the land. The story showcases the rhythmic dances and collaborative efforts of Good Tunong (the fairy), townspeople, warriors, and even monkeys to help the Sultan reclaim the land from the malevolent engkanto.</p>

        <p>History pointed out that migrant from the Christian provinces in Visayas and Luzon settled in this part of the region. Latest survey shows that the Christian-Muslim in the municipality is about 97.3.</p>
        <p>Republic Act No. 58 separated the Barrios of Tubod, Baroy, Lala, Daromawang, Bolod, Taguiquiron, Sagadan and Princesa from its mother municipality of Kolambugan to become a municipality "Tubod" effective October 17, 1946. On February 3, 1982, Parliamentary Bill No. 568 was enacted by the Batasang Pambansa in session assembled, transferring the site of Provincial Government of Lanao del Norte from Iligan City to Municipality of Tubod, making it the "Capital town" of the Lanao del Norte.</p>
        <p>Rufo dela Cruz was sworn into office as the appointed Municipal Mayor on March 14, 1947. In the local election of 1947, Fausto Alvia was elected as Municipal Mayor.</p>
        <p>On March 22, 1949, President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 208, creating the municipality of Lala from the barrios of Rawaan, Gumagamut, Lala (poblacion), Simpak, Daromawang, Abagan, and Lanipao.</p>
        <p>On June 10, 1949, President Quirino issued Executive Order No. 222 creating the Municipality of Baroy whereby all the elected Municipal Officials except the councilor Arsenio A. Quibranza opted to serve Baroy, thus leading to the appointment of the Municipal Officials of Tubod with Arsenio A. Quibranza as Municipal Mayor effective June 24, 1949.</p>
        <p>In 1951 local elections, the latter was elected as the Municipal Mayor and was re-elected twice during the 1955 and 1959 local elections. His term ended on March 8, 1962, when he was appointed by President Diosdado Macapagal as Vice Governor of Lanao del Norte. By the law of succession, Vice Mayor Trifon A. Tabuco became the Municipal Mayor of Tubod and held the position until December 31, 1963.

In the 1971 election, Marcelino Pepito was elected Municipal Mayor, whose term ended on January 31, 1979, when Romana dela Cruz Neri took her oath and assumed office as appointed Municipal Mayor. In the 1980 election, the latter was elected as the Municipal Mayor, whose term ended as an aftermath of the February 25, 1986, EDSA Revolution. The Municipal government of Tubod was governed since by OICs Panfilo dela Cruz, Rooseque B. Calacat, and Panfilo Labunog, respectively, until January 31, 1988. In the February 2, 1988, election, Romana dela Cruz Neri was elected again as the Municipal Mayor of Tubod. She held the same office until she was defeated by Constancio A. Pepito in the 1992 synchronized national and local elections, who held the position for three consecutive terms. In the 2001 elections, Eduardo C. Mansueto was elected as Municipal Mayor and held the position for three consecutive terms. During the national and local election in 2010, Nelieta Quibranza-Noval, who boarded the wagon of politics just like her father the late Arsenio A. Quibranza, was elected as Municipal Mayor and re-elected during the 2016 national and local election but she died on September 7, 2016.</p>
